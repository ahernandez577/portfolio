This mobile application was created using Flutter and the Dart language. The application is connected to Firebase where it stores accounts. There is a register and login page where its then stored in Firebase. Firestore is also used to add your favorite Pokemon information as well. Using Flutter and Firebase to utilize CRUD. This application was a way for me to learn how to create a mobile application and possibly setup for me to learn more about it in the future.
