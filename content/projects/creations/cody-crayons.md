    "description":"A simple horror game project, drawing inspiration from the iconic Slenderman games. With a modest approach, we've created a fun experience, incorporating elements from the Jack Brown Hall CSUSB building to add some familiarity. Cody the Coyote left his crayons out and it is your job to collect them before he gets to you!",

3D Horror Game! Used C-Sharp to create the enemy AI. Utilized Unity's Probuilder tools to create the map and environment. Collaborated with several people to envision the school map in the game. Went through several stages of debugging and optimization. The crayon collectibles are scattered randomly throughout the building changing every time you reload the game. They are set randomly throughout specific teleport locations. The enemy AI is also set to certain locations in the school to appear and hurt the player through their presence alone.
